Company,Year,Quarter,Summary
Brinker International,2017,Q1,"our simplified menu is the fundamental move in the process of growing traffic at Chili's . bank of america's new menu will be more weighted to 2Q than it was last year . the industry performed a little better here in October . fajita category is a strong category for us from a margin and check standpoint . the casual dining industry is operating at a different model than today at $10 or $9 labor . we will remain elevated in our pricing position through the end of this calendar year . burger spot had a pretty good mix, but less than half of the rotation . e-commerce takes a greater share of retail sales, and footfall in every year goes further down in malls ."
Brinker International,2017,Q2,"maggiano's had a solid quarter, primarily driven by strong holiday delivery and take-out business . in December, we completed the implementation of local craft beers and our signature presidente margarita . the menu expands dining options to encourage incremental visits and includes a brunch offering . the new online platform allows us to have all of the company restaurants on that platform . this year as well as prior years, these are quarters where we take a little bit more of a break from the heavy media weight . if we're going to do more family-style options, we'll be able to offer more functionality . maggiano's has a full in-house delivery system with vehicles . the company is evaluating the business model from a third-party perspective . chili's is a concept that resonates really well in different cultures and different countries . the chili peppers chili recipe is available in a variety of flavors and flavors . chili is also available in other chili sauces ."
Brinker International,2017,Q3,"maggiano's delivered a solid third quarter driven by our biggest menu change in 25 years . we moved to a smash burger, a new cooking procedure that produces a juicier product . a 17-year veteran with Brinker with deep expertise in finance and government relations stepped in to take the reins . restaurant-level margin management was a critical driver of quarterly performance . casual dining is under more pressure now than ever to win consumers' hearts and minds . fast food is an all-time high deal rate and casual dining is right up there . a new curbside pickup system is working in test at barclays . restaurant-level operators managed hourly wage cost level actually slightly down year- over-year . the company's goal is to stabilize traffic in a way that doesn't involve serious margin sacrifices"""
Brinker International,2017,Q4,"the response from team members is very supportive . despite the top line challenges, we still made critical investments in our chili's business . the whole operations team is focused on getting food out as quickly as possible . Wyman T. Roberts is not pulling labor out of the model per se . at the end of the day, you really have to get the menu and the food offering right . some of that will be offset with some stronger- value propositions . the 3 biggest players in casual dining are all working on product quality reinvestment ."
Brinker International,2018,Q1,"chili's performance continues to climb, up 2% in comp sales and 4% in traffic for the quarter . to-go business at both brands performed significantly well . Wyman T. Roberts has been able to lean into some of its more traditional value propositions . it also takes pressure off your marketing that you don't have a recreate urgency every 6 or 8 weeks . the average server at chili's averages over $20 an hour . the low-end more budget-conscious consumer is always compelled to find value . media inflation world around television has us scrutinizing that aspect of the marketing budget . we're aggressively looking at how does digital and social play out relative to other . pressure on insurance was 20 basis point drag in this quarter . Mika Ware VP of Finance & Investor Relations Goodbye . we remain committed to our traffic driving strategy and believe there's plenty of upside ."
Brinker International,2018,Q2,"despite ongoing headwinds in the middle east, we're not satisfied . cdo will focus on delivering a great to-go experience to our guests . guests have said they're recognizing the improvements to the menu, especially on key categories . if the fundamental components are unchanged, the increase to the earnings guidance is purely tax . nearly 40, 50 restaurants are now finished in the new england area . there's no major shift in user type or component of the guest mix . ""we're continuing to invest in our infrastructure with regard to digital marketing, but nothing structural that's holding us back now"""
Brinker International,2018,Q3,"maggiano's is excited about taking its delivery program to a more individual level . the 3 for $10 promotion is driving traffic at lunch and dinner . restaurant labor increased 50 basis points as wage-rate pressures continued in the 3% to 4% range . chili's has owned real estate assets of approximately 190 restaurants . we have expectations for a decent mid-single-digit lift from that kind of program . maggiano's is excited about taking its delivery program to a more individual level . moving statutory rates to a lower level does materially decrease the friction that would be involved in transaction . promotional offers are doing well, and the lunch category is starting to move . do you think you need a one-year or onetime pricing reset . the 3 for $10 has been a big traffic benefit this quarter . we've seen improvement across all the dayparts, early week as well as late week lunch and dinner . you may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day . you may be able to disconnect your lines later on ."
Brinker International,2018,Q4,the company reported both top line and EPS growth in its fourth quarter . traffic continued its steady improvement and is now in positive year-over-year territory . reestablishment of my chili's rewards is a marketing strategy that pays out over a longer period of time . company used proceeds from sale leaseback to repay debt . the team's done a great job building that app and making the Chili's take-out experience seamless . the board approved a dividend payout as part of this quarterly announcement .
Brinker International,2019,Q1,"comp sales were positive 2.3% with adjusted net earnings per share of $0.41 . first quarter results came from our strategy to offer convenience the way guests want it . maggiano's was a little tougher quarter, with some headwinds . we're layering in the Midwest region as part of that year-over-year delta . over time, the franchise community tends to move into the same space . we're now through the lap of really the aggressive introduction of 3 for $10 . the restaurant is seeing a good build of the already significant loyalty database . with me on today's call are Wyman Roberts, chief executive officer ."
Brinker International,2019,Q2,"Wyman T. Roberts CEO, President & Non-Independent Director Sure, sure . Wyman and Joe will make prepared comments about our strategic initiatives and operating performance . second quarter marked the 1-year anniversary of the launch of our traffic-focus strategy . chili's continued to grow both dine-in and off-premise sales . the company expects to have tighter cost controls or some programs to address wage pressure and labor cost inflation . 3 for $10 has proven to be a very compelling offer for net-net . the gap to Knapp for the chili's same-store sales was in that 1% range . a year-over-year change in health claims experience exacerbated the difference this year . we didn't see any meaningful good guys as it relates to our experience . the lower tax rate seems to have benefited fiscal '19 earnings by $0.15 . the most important thing, though, is just operational consistency . to-go packaging is the biggest pressure on the bar business . we're absolutely working with the big guys in messaging and delivery . we anticipate consolidation pretty dramatically in this space over time . Wyman T. Roberts CEO, president & non-independent director thanks ."
Brinker International,2019,Q3,"maggiano's has created a program that features premium liquors . with me on the call are Wyman Roberts, president; and Joe Taylor, chief financial officer . but it looks like segment sales may appear weaker here in April or at least choppy . the company has found big players willing to help them with their systems . there's always marketing levers that we can pull to help more aggressively address driving traffic . one of your peers did put up an April same-store sales number last night . Wyman T. Roberts didn't really put a lot of marketing support behind to-go in this quarter . we've chosen to maintain a tight pricing strategy, staying in our targeted range of 1.5% to 2% ."
Brinker International,2019,Q4,"the company reported another quarter of top line and EPS growth . chili's comp sales ended the year up 2.3%, 120 basis points beat to the industry . we're also excited about some of the ideas about how we can take it to new locations . with 53 locations, tons of white space for Maggiano . the industry has seen a couple of soft spots, specifically April and July . to-go has been a nice contributor to comps . my chili's rewards program is just over 12 months post the relaunch . machine learning and artificial intelligence are being used to help drive traffic . manager bonuses and profit sharing piece of equation that flex with business . delivery plays, frankly, probably to a less value-oriented customer . for the first time in recent history, we are required to take the full annual expense of stock-based compensation programs ."
Brinker International,2020,Q1,"both brands continued their nearly 3-year streak of outperforming other casual dining chains . restaurant operating margin improved 60 basis points year-over-year . pandemic hit back in march, the market drove us all to dramatically cut costs . the brand is already generating high satisfaction scores and strong repeat usage . we're evaluating internal and external opportunities to increase awareness levels . independents are seeing outsized gains in smaller markets versus mid to larger-sized markets . in high-volume restaurants, we are looking to be a little more aggressive with plexi . maggiano's is not as big an issue for chili's, but it's where people come in when they're out shopping . the conversation is about whether we have a round of minimum wage increases at the federal level . average house team members are making well over minimum wage . we're going to be the more aggressive player in that development opportunity ."
Brinker International,2020,Q2,"maggiano's had a softer quarter, but finished strong with one of our best holiday seasons . this quarter, we began replacing our original table-top system with new, more advanced system . third-party marketplace continues to be the lion's share of the delivery effort . we're seeing a seasonal build in delivery as we move through the winter . chili's is seeing a month-over-month increase in sales . the good news for us, and for the industry, is it's moving in the right direction . that gives servers freeze-up server time to do other things . the company is also pushing its whole steak portfolio, which is doing well . chili's has its most successful margarita of the month in ever, in January . the economics of third-party delivery are pinned to incrementality . based on the cost structure and the incrementality combined, it makes delivery a really nice piece of business ."
Brinker International,2020,Q3,"with me on today's call are Wyman Roberts, chief executive officer and president . he estimates average weekly burn rate now to be approximately $5 million . chili's is one of the few casual diners that's been able to keep nearly all of its restaurants open . we'll be very judicious in turning on some of those nonessential spends as we go . the ability to give our team members a very detailed labor models is an important piece of the equation . ""we actually have several restaurants with positive comp sales year-over-year"" the bridge is actually starting in short order as we move back into dining room openings . mass and broad traditional marketing is probably not going to be as effective in this environment . social distancing is set up within our restaurants while we work through this next phase . a number of states have allowed delivery of alcohol per se . doordash is pleased with its partnership with keybanc capital markets . we don't have that same relationship building opportunity in dining room . but we do have that opportunity in the dining room as we do in the kitchen ."
Brinker International,2020,Q4,"despite volatility, it's good to see the category and the industry moving in the right direction . maggiano's fiscal 2Q revenue is typically attributable to banquets or large party occasions . digital sales of off-premise meals have grown from low teens to more than 50% . the biggest opportunity in the rest of the fiscal year is getting capacity back online . Wyman T. Roberts will definitely spend fewer dollars in G&A in this fiscal year than in the past typical years . others are food waste, and we're getting mixed feelings on pricing power . we are identifying millions of dollars of opportunities as we wind things back up again . we still as a company with restaurants that are open are seeing positive company-wide average sales growth . ""we're going to be back to these low-single digits"""
Brinker International,2021,Q1,"top line sales performed well and outpaced pre-COVID levels by a very respectable amount . we experienced commodity inflation in the mid-single-digit range, with significant price from pork and chicken . there is leverageability and upside to those margins as we move through the rest of the fiscal year . we saw stable boneless, skinless breast prices for years . the doordash agreement does allow for expansion to third-party aggregators . Deutsche bank's at least $400 million of EBITDA is still a firm figure ."
Brinker International,2021,Q2,"a global pandemic and widespread civil and political interest led to the famine . in the second quarter, chili's increased its 2-year trend of taking share and leading the category . this year, COVID eliminated most of their typically robust banquet and corporate catering channels . ""we are strengthening our balance sheet by deleveraging to below 3.5x lease-adjusted debt"" tabletop device allows you to interact with it before they serve or even gets there . it will allow service to be a little more efficient on a busy friday night . chili's segment restaurant margin moved quarter-over-quarter . we'll use the traditional marketing approaches that you used to build any brand . we've done a couple of acquisitions of franchise that have brought units back into corporate ownership . average tip server is in the $20 range . restaurants in higher-wage states have their own approach to things . the split between delivery and takeout has remained relatively consistent . it's definitely going to be a different landscape post COVID . casual dining sector is under a lot of pressure right now . mika ware, vice president of finance and investor relations, joins michael hochman, co-host ."
Brinker International,2021,Q3,"pent-up demand is getting a lot of publicity and discussion . maggiano's is a good example of a business that isn't reliant on alcoholic beverages . wings is now in 9 countries and 160 locations outside the u.s. the company is hiring more team members than usual to support our increased volumes . we think there's a real nice growth vehicle there against that brand and any other future brand . the digital mix will probably stay in that mid-40% range as dining rooms get back to full capacity . we anticipate that as more people get vaccinated, this will improve and people will feel more comfortable gathering . if you continue this positive trend with vaccinations, towards the end of the year and the holiday season, we could be in a very nice place . underlying COGS pressure is coming, if not for you in the very near term . we don't anticipate having to -- or going back to a very aggressive television campaign . we don't have a big hole to fill with regard to manager bonuses next year . ""it's just wings,"" $150 million-plus, is the next virtual brand to warrant a national rollout ."
Brinker International,2021,Q4,"in a year of social distancing, it's just wings led the industry on traffic and regained positive sales momentum . increase in quarterly tax rate negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS approximately $0.06 . we made a decision in the fourth quarter to create some incremental bonuses . maggiano's Classics is a higher check average product . it's also a value brand, killer wings at stupid price is our tagline . maggiano's classics will build through the year as we roll this thing out over the next few quarters . that's not for fiscal year '22, those will start to fall into place back half of this year . we're very aware of what's going on in the industry, and you're seeing some fairly aggressive moves on pricing . but we've kept pricing power intact, and we will use pricing power . the real issue is more where you're down several, primarily in the heart of the house . awnings at chili's are metal, so we don't have to deal with faded paint . the majority of our U.S. restaurants are company owned . Wyman T. Roberts CEO, president & non-independent director yes ."
Brinker International,2022,Q1,"the company has restructured to bring critical people functions closer to its operations . hospitality is all about making sure we deliver a great experience for dine-in guest and off-premise guests . atmosphere is the guest-facing experience in our dining rooms and bars . restaurant operating margin benefited about 70 basis points due to reclassification . 3 for me has seen significant PPA or average check increases . some customers have moved back to the a la carte to find the items that have removed . cage and chicken pasta, chicken fajitas and the margarita-grill chicken are destination items for Chili' a planned midyear price increase was pulled forward to this October menu . barclays assuming down mid-single-digit traffic in fiscal '23 ."
Brinker International,2022,Q2,"takeout and delivery remained strong in the mid-30s, while dining room demand was on the rise . chili's has more team members on a per restaurant basis today than pre-COVID . re-hire rates for managers who chose to leave have been in the low to mid-single-digit range . we're also doubling down on leadership development programs for both new and tenured managers . chili's has completed the implementation of 2 major technology systems . we're seeing particularly inflationary environments in the cost of sales side of the equation . we do anticipate that those inflationary rates that high single digits will moderate . some in the industry have chosen to partner with companies such as Reef across urban areas . the chili's portfolio has helped us understand how to run in a very tight kitchen environment . we're encouraged and it could be a meaningful growth vehicle for us in the future . maggiano's delivery piece continues to be a real strong driver for them . all participants have been placed on only listen mode ."
Brinker International,2022,Q3,"virtual brands are comping positive, with solid sales levels above pre-pandemic . inflationary pressures throughout the P&L continued in the third quarter . ""we're still seeing some high-single low-teen numbers with regard to various geographical areas"" organic growth is key to that story, and we want to have an organic growth story . we believe commodity prices will moderate, which can have a meaningful impact to margins . pressures throughout the P&L continued in the third quarter . inflationary pressures continued throughout the year . a sluggish third quarter resulted in a slowdown in the equities and london ."
Brinker International,2022,Q4,"my chili's will still play a big role in driving traffic, but there's probably a better way to utilize it . we need to talk about the unbeatable value on our 3 for Me menu . virtual brands are currently about 6% of mix . core chilis does roughly 5 to 6x the business in our virtual brands . traffic was negative at Chili's for the quarter and decelerated throughout as guests react to the challenging inflationary environment . the relative mix dine-in to off-prem has remained relatively consistent . ""we have 2 really superior values in our restaurants today"" the 3 for Me program is essentially an appetizer, an entree and unlimited drinks starting at $10.99 ."
Brinker International,2023,Q1,"as we move further into the fiscal year, we anticipate delivering sustained traffic growth . we're seeing mix move into the new premium margaritas and guest trade into full-price wings and Crispers . more hard at work is the next label Core 4 improvements . manager turnover returning to lower industry- leading levels and sales leverage against fixed labor costs were driving factors . we are off to a good start to the year and are gaining increasing confidence in our strategies . virtual brands are contributing 4% of the overall 5.8% traffic decline . ""it's a good all-in traffic expectation we should be having in the near and medium term"" if traffic was positive year-on-year, it was also a positive gap versus the industry in October . we won't get like the current advertising campaigns impact on awareness until a few months after . off-premise business at Chili's and Maggiano's was relatively stable quarter-to-quarter . we're continuing to improve the customer experience, improve the Core 4 and get back on air advertising with outstanding value . chili's has made great progress on the equipment side of the equation . the bigger question is how do we sustain traffic over-time . virtual brands are contributing 4% of the overall 5.8% traffic decline . restaurant margin helped by de- emphasis of virtual brands, lower packaging and delivery costs . as we move further into the fiscal year, we anticipate delivering sustained traffic growth ."
Brinker International,2023,Q2,"the company is adamant about protecting the price points for guests that would otherwise not be able to afford Chili's or casual dining . the off-premise business delivered an 82% increase versus prepandemic levels . second quarter same-store sales were up 8% . this quarter, we'll start reinvesting some of our dollars saved from less discounting to get back on TV with a 3 For Me value platform . ""we have seen a low-end customer tail-off"" before we took incremental pricing . our value scores this quarter ticked up, which would be surprising given the price increases . the demographics using that is probably skews towards the higher economic side of the equation . that's $10.99 for a complete meal with unlimited chips and salsa, a full-size entree and a bottomless drink . the return to TV advertising will be about abundant value at a sharp price point . traffic in dining room down a little bit relative to prepandemic dining room . chili's has seen dramatic declines in top-of-mind awareness during the pandemic . a mild recession could have a positive impact on the restaurant industry . if the macros continue to get worse, what you see them do is they can't afford a bad experience ."
Brinker International,2023,Q3,"Nicolaus & company has been deemphasizing the virtual brands . we're executing better than we have in a long time, delivering abundant value with high quality at sharp price points . i made structural changes to consolidate our marketing team to drive traffic and frequency . chili's is reinvesting its energy and resources into what we call core 4 segments . both brands reported meaningful top line sales growth . a trend in the last 5 to 10 years is that, customers are willing to pay for high-quality products . George and his team are putting together a broader-based marketing campaign . chili started raising menu prices later in the cycle than many of its competitors . the other is a tailwind -- things like food grade, intent to return, server attentiveness . food and beverage expected to see continued improvement as a percent of company sales . commodity inflation expected to be down in the lower single-digit range . we have a very different merchandising strategy this time around with TV advertising . we made significant changes to our in-restaurant merchandising strategy versus the last time we ran national tv ads . i made structural changes to consolidate our marketing team to drive traffic and frequency ."
Brinker International,2023,Q4,"a year ago, we challenged our vice presidents of operations to get after one obsession metric . we significantly improved managerial turnover and we are now better than pre-pandemic levels . the biggest change is going into the deep end on how much money we're going to invest in advertising . chili's closed 12 openings, gross openings for the year . but the earnings per share range implied growth that was much wider . we feel like we have a recipe for success on that . two questions for cnn.com's john sutter . it's just wings, boneless and bone-in wings, different piece counts, all the sauces . ad spend will be chunky around football season or evenly spread throughout the year . there will also be culture pops that will keep chili's in the news between big tentpole programs . if you're seeing demographically specific success, you can look into it . if it's a 'successful' demographic, you could look into that ."
Brinker International,2024,Q2,"a high-quality complete meal at a great value is winning with guests . improvement in the guest experience is leading to better overall experience . the 12-month turnover improved another 2 points to 22% . we haven't seen any material change in the operations of our business . Kesadiaz is now only in the tray section, and we've completely removed from advertisers . we think that more of our hours will stay with us past that 30-, 60- and 90-day mark . the menu we dropped yesterday included close to 2% of incremental price . a conservative consumer is showing signs of slowing down . that will get incorporated into the F '25 guidance, which will be dependent upon rate curves . the rate curve will be adjusted to reflect the change in rate ."
Conagra Brands,2016,Q2,"we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating for the business . we will continue to move with urgency, but our efforts will require time and investment . our success will require us to break a number of bad habits . Divestitures and FX negatively impacted net sales by 5.5% . we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating for the business . reddi-wip, egg beaters and other costs impacted adjusted operating profit . the company doesn't commit capital upfront, but repatriates innovation once it's proven . phasing out 3Q and 4Q in the second half is going to be a big step . if you want to know more, you can send us a message on cnn ireport ."

Conagra Brands,2017,Q3,"Darren C. Serrao, co-COO and executive VP, believes the aggregate performance of the food industry does not reflect the underlying growth opportunities . he has taken a series of actions across his portfolio in order to reach these opportunity areas . there's clearly been a shift to nonmeasured channels in the last few months . we still do plenty of promoting, and we still have a large trade budget . in the most recent case with Thanasi Foods, it happened to be a modernizing acquisition . Darren connolly is president, CEO & director at a&p firm ."
Conagra Brands,2017,Q4,"becoming a pure play has enabled us to sharpen our focus on the critical elements necessary to improve performance . adobo chicken, Korean beef, chicken sausage and barley and Cuban pork are the flavors . we are pleased with the great progress we have made and about the continuous improvement mindset . egg beaters product supply was not impacted by the avian flu issue . we expect reported net sales growth to be down 2% to flat . if we have to take price, they will still be a terrific value relative to alternatives . retraining the consumer to buy our products in a non-merchandised condition .

Conagra Brands,2018,Q1,"organic net sales increased 1.2% with all 4 operating segments delivering year-over-year growth . Organic net sales growth ex Trenton was 1.2%, driven by a 1.2% increase in price/mix . our 2-year CAGR shows just how much we've delivered in recent years . the increase was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense . we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in total debt, approximately $75 million of cash flow on hand . we'll begin the important prep work that is required for an Investor Day next calendar year . a&p, above-the-trade line considerations have shifted significantly over the last 5 years . the days on hand that retailers keep these days versus 10, 20 years ago is significantly smaller . the increase was primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense . the increase in compensation expense was driven by a higher stock price ."
Conagra Brands,2018,Q2,"organic net sales, excluding the effects of the sale of Trenton, were down 1.6% . with Birds Eye, it had extended too far and missed some segments of the market . we continue to see years of runway in frozen and expect the space to benefit from long-term demographic tailwinds . birds eye, Wish-Bone and Duncan Hines have all suffered sales and distribution losses this past year . on sales, we now estimate the portfolio will land calendar year '18 at roughly $3 billion . despite recent declines in sales and distribution, base velocities are improving . pinnacle will implement its value-over-volume approach . we expect to over-deliver on our synergy targets without incurring any cash cost . we see incremental savings, primarily in the areas of SG&A and procurement . pinnacle's [ near end ] business weakness is causing lower EPS growth . but given the synergy over-delivery, we expect to get right back to the same place at EPS by 2022 . half of that miss was from the inflation on freight transportation and higher vegetable inflation . a slight miss in the second quarter for the base conagra business sounds like it was a calendar shift . birds eye is an example by a country mile, so we'll get it back in when the products are ready . it doesn't allow you to show the full calendar 2019 Pinnacle because it's our fiscal year, so hopefully, that sheds a little light on the gross margin dynamic ."

Conagra Brands,2018,Q4,"organic net sales grew 2%, driven by solid growth in both of our domestic retail segments . this has translated into very strong returns for our shareholders . the combined company will be the #2 player in frozen foods with $4.9 billion . the segment has now begun to lap its value-over-volume action . a vegetable processing plant is not the same as a frozen food manufacturing plant . pinnacle has clearly proven their ability to drive productivity and margin improvement . the company is a lean company, but we're a company that's focused on growth . if we were to look at cash EPS accretion, we'd be double digits . the Wish-Bone business fits very close to home with what we do with Hunt's ketchup, frontera salsa . we don't anticipate any antitrust issues, but are evaluating potential divestiture candidates ."
