The fourth quarter was a strong finish to our fiscal year 2021 plan . we're evaluating how we'll address those opportunities this year . Food and beverage expense for the fourth quarter as a percent of company sales was 20 basis points unfavorable . reality of the pandemic with all its uncertainties is still part of our everyday operations . all now 4 of our brands are well prepared and positioned to perform in whatever environment they face throughout the year . we're seeing a little bit of what i would consider to be transitory costs . we made a decision in the fourth quarter to create some incremental bonus structures . Maggiano's classics will build through the year as we roll this thing out over the next few quarters . Wings is more of a family offering . the company is targeting maybe to be over 2 here and there before the second quarter . We're excited to finally get this thing rolled out company-wide by november . levy: ""there are still pockets out there where we don't have fully staffed"" ""we're not going to get x amount of great benefit in my current environment from a labor perspective"" we'll continue to pay debt down and grow the business, but we generated a lot of cash . that guidance does incorporate some thinking about what might go on this fiscal year . the movement from just fourth quarter to july was impressive . the business side of the equation hasn't come back as much yet .

We chose not to repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to prioritize paying down debt . Organic net sales to decrease between 1% and 2% compared to fiscal '23 with volumes continuing to improve through the back half of the the macro environment has challenged volumes for the group a bit longer than expected . but before you can return to volume growth, you have to sunset the declines . with the bomb that comes due in may, the leverage at least has stabilized .
